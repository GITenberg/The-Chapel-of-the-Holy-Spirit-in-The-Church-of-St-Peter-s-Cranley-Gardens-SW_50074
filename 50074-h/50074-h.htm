3</span>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> consecration of the new Chapel
of the Holy Spirit by the Bishop of London, on Tuesday, the 25th
May, 1909, marks the completion of the large scheme for the
enlargement and beautifying of St. Peter&rsquo;s, upon which the
Church Council has been earnestly engaged for nearly three
years.&nbsp; The new organ has already been very fully described
in the &ldquo;Dedication Service&rdquo; booklets of last year,
and it has been suggested that some description of the chapel may
be of interest to many who worship at St. Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Those who read it must pardon the writer if from inexperience or
lack of knowledge he has failed adequately or accurately to
describe it, or if, in describing it, he may have been driven by
the depth of his own feelings to strike too personal a note.</p>
<p>The chapel has been erected to form at once an integral
portion of the church and a feature distinctive in itself.&nbsp;
Ancient precedents for such treatment are numerous, wherein a
richness of material or ornament marks the chapel as a pious
memorial or its erection as an act of devotion.&nbsp; In this
case it is attached to the north side of the chancel, and opens
from the north transept by a wide and simply moulded archway in
harmony with the chancel arch.&nbsp; A short neck, lighted by a
long lancet, connects it somewhat more richly with the
chancel.</p>
<p>Occasion has been taken to gain light in this corner of the
building, and the exigencies of lighting in a confined area have
largely controlled the form of the chapel.&nbsp; It consists upon
the ground floor of three bays, in the upper part of two
only.&nbsp; The east window is thrown back from the party wall,
and carried by a rich segmental arch at the end of the second
bay.&nbsp; The recess thus formed at the east end shelters the
altar and reredos under a panelled vault into which the canopies
grow.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The two
loftier bays of the chapel have LIERNE and slightly domical
vaults, each compartment intersected by the figure of a cross
formed by the ribbing, which is brought down in an Ogee point to
the wall rib.&nbsp; The springers are arranged to form canopies
over a series of sixteen figures&mdash;Angels, Apostles,
Prophets, Martyrs and Holy Church, the Archangel Gabriel and the
Blessed Virgin in the Annunciation flanking the east
window.&nbsp; The head of our Lord crowns the eastern vault, and
in the surrounding bosses angels bear the emblems of the
Passion.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, surrounded
by angels bearing the insignia of the various learned societies
with which the donors are associated, decorate the western
bay.</p>
<p>Upon the walls the ornament is confined to the lower parts,
which are richly arcaded on the north side, and occupied by
Sedilia and Piscina on the south.&nbsp; A bronze railing with
gates separates the chapel from the transept, and access is given
to the chapel from the clergy vestry by a narrow carved oak
door.&nbsp; With the exception of the mullions of the windows
which are of Doulting stone, only fine Bath stone has been used
in the interior of the chapel, the exterior being finished in
Doulting and Kentish Rag.</p>
<p>The above is a concise general description of the chief
features of the chapel drawn from notes kindly furnished by Mr.
W. D. Car&ouml;e (the architect), of 3, Great College Street,
Westminster, to whose designs and under whose supervision the
chapel has been erected.&nbsp; So far, therefore, there is not
much difficulty.&nbsp; The difficulty begins when we commence to
try and describe the many details of the chapel interior.&nbsp;
It is almost impossible to convey adequately to a reader
<i>all</i> the many thoughts and ideas that have been worked up
into and enwrapped in the carved stone or painted glass or mosaic
that will go with other things to complete the little
chapel.&nbsp; There is much that is very personal about it,
perhaps too deep for words, but the spirit of the chapel may be
the more easily comprehended, if only those who read this will
remember three things.&nbsp; In the first place, it is a
<i>morning</i> chapel primarily, nay, essentially, intended for
the administration of the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Holy Communion.&nbsp; In the second
place, it is to be <i>dedicated to the Holy Spirit</i>,
&ldquo;the Spirit of Truth,&rdquo; the promised Comforter by
whose light the hearts of all faithful people were to be taught
and all the sayings of our Lord Jesus Christ were to be brought
into remembrance.&nbsp; Lastly, it is a chapel which has been
<i>built to the glory and praise of God</i>, and <i>as a
memorial</i> by children and descendants to their beloved parents
and forefathers, of whom many, though born in New England and
educated at her Universities of Harvard and Yale, have always
valued and kept close the ties that bound them to that older
England in which their forefathers were born, and to those older
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in which their forefathers
were nurtured.&nbsp; Those who in the days before the
Commonwealth went forth from the Old England across the broad
Atlantic to lay the foundations of a Commonwealth not unworthy to
be called by the name of New England carried with them from
Oxford and from Cambridge the spirit of places where Culture was
not as yet largely dissociated from Religion, and where faithful
regard was as yet paid to a founder&rsquo;s injunction:
&ldquo;Religionis puritatem ac vit&aelig; ad posteros nostros
propagare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their descendants may be pardoned if,
looking back through the centuries to the great Universities of
those days, and regarding them as centres not merely of culture,
but also of religious light and truth, they picture them as being
the instruments by which the Holy Spirit has moved the world, and
have tried in the vaulting of the chapel roof to transmute this
idea into carved stone.</p>
<p>With these explanatory remarks it may now be possible to
enable the reader the more easily to catch the spirit of the
place.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>THE
GROINED ROOF.</h2>
<p>The groined roof is divided into two bays, and in each bay
there is a large central boss, having eight bosses encircling it,
four large and four small ones, the four small ones being in each
case the further away from the centre.&nbsp; In the eastern bay
from the central boss looks down upon us the face of the
Redeemer, crowned with thorns, surrounded by six angels carrying
in their hands shields bearing the emblems of the Passion.&nbsp;
The other two bosses in this bay are foliated and bear the
&ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; and &ldquo;Omega.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the western bay the large central boss is carved with the
symbol of the Holy Spirit, the hovering dove, from which emanate
rays of light spreading in every direction, and forming a
radiating aureole about it.&nbsp; Around it, receptive of the
light, are grouped angels carrying in their hands shields bearing
the arms of the great Universities of England and New England and
of the Colleges and School with which the donors of the chapel
and their people have been associated.&nbsp; Oxford and Cambridge
face Harvard, and Yale, and outside them on the outer ring Eton
faces Trinity College, Cambridge, and New College, Oxford, faces
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Harvard being nearest to Emmanuel
from which it directly derives descent.&nbsp; It may be of
interest to note here that the secure foundation of civil and
religious life in New England, and the subsequent pre-eminence of
Massachusetts and Connecticut in shaping the policy of national
life and in the vigour of their moral and intellectual life, is
largely traceable to those who went forth from Oxford and
Cambridge, and, as far as Cambridge is concerned, from Trinity
and Emmanuel.&nbsp; New College is also pleasurably associated in
our minds with our present Vicar, Rev. W. S. Swayne, as Trinity
College, Cambridge, is with Mr. W. D. Car&ouml;e, the architect
of the chapel.</p>
<p>On the day of consecration there will be sung before the
Communion service Gounod&rsquo;s anthem, &ldquo;Send out Thy
Light and Thy Truth, let them lead me,&rdquo; one peculiarly
appropriate in the case of a chapel to be dedicated to the Holy
Spirit, and it may be of interest to some to note in connection
with the carving of the bosses of this western bay how closely
the mottoes of the Universities bear out the idea of their having
been intended to be centres of religious light and truth, the
motto of Oxford being &ldquo;Dominus illuminatio mea,&rdquo;
whilst Harvard bears upon its shield &ldquo;Veritas,&rdquo; and
Yale &ldquo;Light and Truth,&rdquo; or rather the Hebrew
equivalents therefore, carrying <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>us back in thought to the Urim and
Thummim, the jewels indicative of purity and perfection that
gleamed on the breastplate of the Jewish High Priest.</p>
<h2>THE SPRINGERS.</h2>
<p>Coming down now to the carved springers, we must bear in mind
that the building of the chapel is &ldquo;to the glory and praise
of God,&rdquo; and that it has been the object of the donors of
the chapel to try and express in the springers and groined roof
the spirit of the great festal expressions of Christian
thanksgiving and praise contained in our Prayer Book in the
&ldquo;Te Deum Laudamus&rdquo; (verses 1&ndash;13) and in the
great Eucharistic thanksgiving.&nbsp; As we raise our eyes to the
&ldquo;angel&rdquo; bosses of the groining and to the springers
of the eastern bay we can say, &ldquo;Therefore with the angels
and archangels and all the company of Heaven we laud and magnify
Thy glorious Name,&rdquo; &ldquo;To Thee all angels cry
aloud,&rdquo; for the Redeemer looks down upon us surrounded by
the angels, and beneath the springer canopies there stand the
figures of the archangels, &ldquo;the seven spirits that are ever
before the throne of God,&rdquo; and of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
to whom was given by the Early Church the sweet title of the
Queen of the Angels, &ldquo;Regina Angelorum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the north-east springer stands St. Michael (like unto God)
Captain-General of the Host of Heaven, Patron Saint and Prince of
the Church Militant, the Archangel of the Judgment, bearing in
his hands the sword and scales, and with his armour scarce
covered by his ample cloak.&nbsp; By him stands St. Gabriel (God
is my strength), the Archangel of the Annunciation, bearing in
his hands the sceptre, and with the scroll inscribed &ldquo;Ave
Maria, Gratia Plena.&rdquo;&nbsp; Facing them, in the south-east
springer stands the Blessed Virgin Mary, and next her St. Raphael
(the medicine of God), the chief of guardian angels, the angel of
the pilgrims, with the pilgrim&rsquo;s staff and gourd.&nbsp; In
the south-west springer of this bay, Jophiel (the beauty of God),
the archangel of Truth and guardian of the Tree of Knowledge,
stands with the flaming sword next to Chamuel (one who sees God)
the archangel of the Sacrament, holding the chalice in his hand,
whilst in the north-west springer, Zadkiel (the righteousness of
God), the angel who stayed the hand of Abraham from sacrificing
Isaac, is seen, holding the sacrificial knife, with Uriel near
him, Uriel, the archangel of the Light of God, bearing the Roll
and Book.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Passing
to the western bay we find, as we look round, that the springers
continue the tale of praise to God, from all the glorious company
of the apostles, from the goodly fellowship of the prophets, from
Martyred Saint and Holy Church.&nbsp; St. Paul, the great apostle
of the Gentiles, bearing the emblematic sword, is grouped with
the youthful St. John, the beloved apostle, with the chalice in
his hand from which the serpent issues, and at his feet the
symbolic eagle.&nbsp; David the King, the psalmist prophet, with
sceptre and harp, is with Isaiah, the &ldquo;Prophet of
Faith,&rdquo; the great foreteller of the Messianic deliverance
and of the Coming of the Prince of Peace.&nbsp; St. Stephen, the
sweet proto-martyr of the Christian Church, stands in the
south-west springer with St. Alban, the Christian soldier, and
first of all our British saints and martyrs.&nbsp; Last of all,
in the north-west springer is &ldquo;Holy Church&rdquo;
represented by St. Peter, prince of the Apostles, &ldquo;The Rock
upon which the Church of Christ was to be built,&rdquo; and by
Frederick Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury, wearing his cope, and
carrying his archiepiscopal staff.&nbsp; It was said, half
musingly, by one who saw this last springer in the carving, that
the builders had, perhaps unconsciously, elected that Holy Church
should be represented by a temple.&nbsp; The connection between
the name and the object to be represented was, it is true, not
perceived by them, but the selection was of fixed design.&nbsp;
To those who knew and valued the great archbishop, who passed
away in 1903 in the fulness of years, his great qualities and his
eminent services to the Church seemed to mark him out as
specially fitted to stand beside St. Peter, both truly
representative of the Church of Christ.</p>
<h2>ORNAMENTAL CARVING.</h2>
<p>All round the chapel on either side, above the arcading and
sedilia, and in the recess in which the Holy Table is placed,
runs, carved in stone, the trailing vine with leaves and grapes,
emblematic of our Saviour, &ldquo;The True Vine,&rdquo; and of
the Wine of the Holy Eucharist; and in the carving of the
arcading and sedilia and of the small bosses of the quatrefoil
work of the arch that carries the east window, will be found the
pomegranate, the lily, and the rose, symbols of Hope and
Immortality, of Purity and Love, together with the eagle of St.
John and the crossed keys of St. Peter.</p>
<h2>THE REREDOS.</h2>
<p>At the back of the Holy Table stands the Reredos, of
richly-carved Bath stone, the general idea of the sculpture <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>being
&ldquo;the one great sacrifice of our Blessed Lord,&rdquo; made
with blood-shedding upon the Cross, represented in the
Crucifixion.&nbsp; Examining the reredos more in detail, it will
be observed that the whole is divided into three sections of
richly canopied niches by slender buttresses, upon which are
angel figures holding shields carved with the emblems of the Four
Evangelists.&nbsp; In the central section our attention is first
of all directed to the offering of the Great High Priest of the
&ldquo;one oblation of Himself once offered on the
Cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sculptor has succeeded in combining that
which it is so difficult to do, the true pathos of human
suffering with the dignity of the Divine personality of the Holy
Victim.&nbsp; On either side of the crucified Son of God are the
Blessed Virgin Mary and St. John, whilst in the two smaller
niches are the figures of the two Maries, Mary the wife of
Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>The reredos and the whole of the carved work throughout the
chapel are the work of Mr. Nathaniel Hitch, the well-known
sculptor of Harleyford Road, Vauxhall, who has been ably assisted
throughout by Mr. Harold Whitaker.</p>
<h2>THE ALTAR AND ITS FURNITURE.</h2>
<p>The altar itself, which is of carved English oak, and made by
Messrs. Dart &amp; Francis of Crediton to Mr. Car&ouml;e&rsquo;s
design has a front divided by carved work into three recessed
compartments, into which will fit frontal panels of plain oak, or
of beautifully embroidered work, as occasion demands.&nbsp; There
are four separate sets of these embroidered panels (white, red,
green and purple) the material of which is in all cases a rich
brocade, upon which very beautiful designs specially made by Mr.
Car&ouml;e, have been embroidered by Miss Hilda C. Morris (with
the assistance of Miss Parson and Miss Butler) at her studio, 10,
Victoria Grove, S.W.&nbsp; It would take too long to describe the
designs in detail, as, though small, they are very full of
thought and work, and have taken a long time to carry out, but to
those who are interested in church embroidery they will doubtless
prove of very special interest.</p>
<p>It may be of interest to mention here the eucharistic vessels
and the candlesticks and flower vases, all of which are of
silver, and have been made from Mr. Car&ouml;e&rsquo;s designs by
Miss Woodward at her studio, 5 and 7, Johnson Street,
Notting-hill Gate.&nbsp; The chalice, which is of the late Gothic
type, is about 7 inches high, having a circular bowl, round the
rim <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>of
which are engraved in appropriate lettering the words:
&ldquo;Calicem Salutaris accipiam et nomen Domini
invocabo.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stem and foot are hexagonal, and with
the knop are richly decorated with Gothic ornament.&nbsp; The
paten fits on to the top of the chalice, forming a cover
thereto.&nbsp; Round its edge runs the inscription, &ldquo;Hoc
est corpus meum quod pro vobis datur,&rdquo; whilst across its
entire surface is embossed a cross, in the centre of which is the
sacred monogram in low relief, as are also the squares of Gothic
leaf ornament at the end of the arms.</p>
<p>The flower vases are some 6 inches high, oval in section with
slight angular ribs, and narrowed below the neck and above the
foot.&nbsp; Each has a marguerite engraved upon it, emblem of the
donor&rsquo;s name, and an ornamental initial letter M.</p>
<p>The candlesticks are oblong in section, with one broad side
forming the front, the shafts being decorated with emblematic
marguerites and tracery work upon a background of blue
enamel.&nbsp; An Ornamental initial letter M and the date are
engraved upon the fronts of the feet, which, like the bowls, are
of simple form in hammered silver, the decoration being confined
to the shafts.</p>
<h2>THE PAVEMENT OF THE CHAPEL.</h2>
<p>With the exception of those portions upon which the chairs
will stand and which are laid in oak blocks, the whole flooring
of the chapel is laid in marble or marble mosaic, after the
fashion of the old Cosmati work of the 12th <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> and 13th century.&nbsp; This work has
been carried out to a special design prepared by Mr. Car&ouml;e,
by Messrs. Arthur Lee &amp; Bros., Ltd., Marble Workers, of
Hayes, Middlesex.</p>
<p>There is a good deal that may possibly be of interest in this
pavement, both because of the class of work and the variety of
marbles used therein, and because of the symbolic nature of
certain portions.&nbsp; We will deal, first, with the actual
steps in the chapel.&nbsp; The two steps (Nos. 1 and 2) at the
western end are laid in Lunel, the next step as you walk east
(No. 3) being of an Austrian marble, &ldquo;St. Just,&rdquo;
whilst the three easternmost steps (Nos. 4, 5 and 6) leading to
and nearest the altar, are of white statuary, grand antique, and
Rosso Antico, respectively.&nbsp; To Dante lovers, and there are
doubtless many such in St. Peter&rsquo;s congregation, these
easternmost steps will recall the splendid symbolism of the
passage from the <i>Purgatorio</i> (Canto IX. 94&ndash;102),
which tells how Dante came to the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Gate of Purgatory, carried thither
from the Flowery Valley by the eagle, Lucia, a symbol of the
illuminating grace of God:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La&rsquo; ve venimmo, alio scaglion
primaio,<br />
Bianco marmo, era si pulito e terso,<br />
Ch&rsquo; io mi specchiai in esso quale io paio.<br />
Era il secondo, tinto pi&ugrave; che perso,<br />
D&rsquo; una petrina ruvida ed arsiccia,<br />
Crepata per lo lungo e per traverso.<br />
Lo terzo, che di sopra s&rsquo;ammassiccia,<br />
Porfido mi parea si fiammegiante,<br />
Come sangue che fuor di vena spiccia.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and which Mr. William Warren Vernon in his admirable edition
translated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There, where we came unto the first stair,
it was of white marble, so polished and smooth, that in it I saw
myself reflected even as I am.&nbsp; The second was of a darker
hue than perse, and of a rugged and calcined stone, full of
cracks in all its length and breadth.&nbsp; The third, which is
piled on above, seemed to me to be of porphyry, as flaming red as
blood that gushes from a vein.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage has been variously interpreted, nearly all the
early commentators holding that by the three steps, by which the
gate of Purgatory is approached, Dante intended to symbolize the
three acts of penitence, as they were understood in the days of
scholastic theology, namely, (1) contrition of the heart, (2)
confession of the mouth, and (3) satisfaction by works, whilst in
days nearer to our own Dean Plumptre has observed that (1) the
white marble in which Dante saw himself mirrored indicates purity
of conscience and that self-knowledge without which contrition is
incomplete; (2) the dark, gloomy hue, the broken and rough
surface of the second stair symbolizes the state of the heart as
laid bare in confession in all its black unrighteousness; (3) the
crimson hue of the porphyry is fit emblem of the charity or love
which is the spring of all works of satisfaction.&nbsp; But
whatever may be the exact meaning of Dante&rsquo;s symbolism, the
general idea is plain, and the symbolism of these three steps,
white, black, and red, seems peculiarly appropriate in a chapel
to be used so largely for the administration of the Holy
Communion, at which the Invitation and Confession alike will be
made in words, with which the symbolism of the steps is so fully
in harmony.</p>
<p>With regard to the mosaic pavement itself, we cannot do better
than append the short descriptive notes that have been <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>very kindly
furnished by Mr. C. White, the courteous Works Manager of Messrs.
Arthur Lee &amp; Bros.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Portion directly under Altar</i> is
composed of Vedrasse panels with Rosso Antico crosses inlaid in
same.&nbsp; The panel coming directly in front of this is
composed of star-shaped pieces of St. Just with cosmatesque
inlays round same composed of various fancy coloured marbles and
borders in St. Just.&nbsp; Foot-pace and riser are in Rosso
Antico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Portion on the left of the Altar</i>.&mdash;The
front panel is in Skyros, the back one in Vedrasse, the centre
panel in St. Katharine&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Circular panels&mdash;top
left-hand corner, Br&egrave;che Sanguine; bottom left-hand
corner, Irish green; top right-hand corner, landscape; bottom
right-hand corner, Devonshire.&nbsp; The matrix and outside

<h2>THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS.</h2>
<p>It remains now to deal with the stained glass of the chapel
windows.&nbsp; The carrying out of this very important part of
the chapel decoration has been entrusted to Messrs. James Powell
&amp; Sons, Whitefriars Glass Works, Tudor Street, E.C., the
whole of the windows having been executed by them to designs
prepared by Mr. James C. Powell, to whom warm thanks are due for
the very special interest which he has so kindly taken in the
work.&nbsp; It was decided after careful consideration to follow
the style of the 15th century (late Gothic) glass, is which it
was found possible in a singularly effective way to enshrine in a
mass of white glass just enough colour to give richness without
great loss of light.&nbsp; The charm of this old glass of the
Perpendicular period was to be found in its more pictorial
quality and in its extreme brilliancy, large masses of silvery
white and golden-hued yellow glass being introduced.&nbsp; In the
chapel windows the glass has been treated in a translucent way
and every effort made to secure brilliancy by using glass of very
varying thickness.&nbsp; The keynote to the subjects of the east
window and of the three-light south window is to be found in
Galatians v. 22, 23:&mdash;&ldquo;But the fruit of the Spirit is
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>love, joy,
peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
temperance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These windows are intended to recall that verse, and to
illustrate some of the greatest instances of the outpouring of
the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The East Window</span>.</h3>
<p>In the two outer lower lights of the east window are St. John
and St. Peter, types of love and faith, whilst in the upper or
tracery lights of the window, angels bear scrolls inscribed with
the Spirit&rsquo;s fruits, and in the topmost lozenge-shaped
light is the motto of some of the donors of the chapel,
&ldquo;Scuto fidei.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the four centre lower lights
are the two great scenes of the Annunciation and of the Baptism
of our Lord, scenes so beautifully connected with the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit as the words of Holy Scripture show (see Luke
i. 35, and Matthew iii. 11 and 16).</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The South Window</span>.</h3>
<p>The south window has been chosen to <i>illustrate
specially</i> the greatest of all these fruits,
&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; and in the lower portion thereof is depicted
the Blessed Virgin Mary with the Infant Saviour in her arms,
surrounded by angels, whilst in the upper lights, which are
indicative of the Passion, are two angels, one bearing the Cross
and the other the chalice and the Crown of Thorns.&nbsp; Above
their heads are the Cross and the Crown of Victory, and other
symbols of the Passion, and in the topmost light, the Holy
Dove.&nbsp; Perhaps no better subject could be found to
illustrate the greatest Love human and divine than the human
Mother with her Divine Son, the only begotten of the Father, whom
the Father in His infinite love of the world gave for man&rsquo;s
redemption.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Long Lancet</span>.</h3>
<p>For the long lancet window that faces east it was extremely
difficult to find a subject, owing to its extreme narrowness and
height.&nbsp; Many subjects were tried, but in the end the
difficulty was solved by a chance holiday visit to an old Cornish
church at St. Neots, and by the reading of a passage out of the
&ldquo;Legend of the Cross&rdquo; in Baring Gould&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Curious Myths of the Middle Ages,&rdquo; pp.
379&ndash;382, <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> which was <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>called to mind by a valued Cornish
friend.&nbsp; Out of the &ldquo;Legend of the Cross,&rdquo; one
of the greatest popularity in the Middle Ages, and often lending
itself to representation in varied form in fresco or stained
glass, has been designed a window which tells of &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paradise Regained,&rdquo; lost when Adam
was driven forth from Eden, but regained through the Saviour who
died upon the Cross, made, so the Legend runs, from the wood of
the three trees which, incorporated and confounded as to their
several natures in a single trunk, had grown from the three seeds
of the Tree of Life, given to Seth by the Guardian Angel and
planted by him in his father&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Tree
had grown till its branches reached heaven.&nbsp; The boughs were
covered with leaves and flowers and fruit.&nbsp; But the fairest
fruit was a little babe, a living sun, who seemed to be listening
to the songs of seven white doves who circled round his
head.&rdquo;&nbsp; So runs the legend of the vision of the son of
Adam, as, stopped at Eden&rsquo;s gate by the angel with the
flaming sword, he looked into the future.&nbsp; Perhaps, after
all, this vision of the redemption of mankind by the coming of
the Saviour endowed with all the seven-fold gifts of the Spirit,
is not an unworthy subject for a stained glass window in a
Christian church to-day.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Piscina Window</span>.</h3>
<p>The little window over the Piscina tells of the vision of
Isaiah (Isaiah vi. 11).&nbsp; &ldquo;Then flew one of the
seraphims, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken
with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my mouth,
and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
taken away, and thy sin purged.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close to this little
window is the Holy Table, from which is to be daily given the
body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ for the preservation of
body and soul unto everlasting life, and it has seemed
appropriate to tell nearby in stained glass the story of that
earlier cleansing by the coal from off the altar.</p>
<h2>THE MEMORIAL TABLET.</h2>
<p>The chapel contains only one memorial inscription, which is in
raised letters on the wall of the Piscina, and runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A M D G maiores dilectos sive in Anglia
sive ultra Atlanticum mare natos studio ac pietate prosecuti hoc
sacellum Sancti Spiritus &aelig;dificandum atque ornandum
curaverunt minores.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Lucia

<p>Godofredus Grant Morris.</p>
<p>Margarita Picton Grant Morris.</p>
<p>Arturus Le Blanc Grant Morris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. S.&nbsp; MDCCCCIX.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is fitting that this little description should end with an
acknowledgment of the deep obligation that we are under to all
those, masters and men, men of various crafts and occupations,
who have worked so efficiently and with such unremitting care in
the erection of the little chapel.&nbsp; The task has been one of
more than ordinary difficulty, owing to the cramped nature of the
chapel site and the many details involved in its construction and
decoration, but, despite the many difficulties, all employed upon
the work have cheerfully given the best of their skill and
experience to the successful accomplishment thereof, and a
special word of thanks is due to Mr. A. J. White, the Clerk of
the Works, and to Mr. Ward, the Work&rsquo;s Foreman to Messrs.
Collins &amp; Godfrey, of Tewkesbury, the contractors.</p>
<p>The chapel itself will, we hope, always stand as a beautiful
reminder of the deep debt of thanks that St. Peter&rsquo;s owes
to Mr. W. D. Car&ouml;e, its architect and designer.</p>
<p>Longfellow once wrote of a great minster:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;So, as I enter here from day to day,<br
/>
And leave my burden at this minster gate,<br />
Kneeling in prayer and not ashamed to pray,<br />
The tumult of the time disconsolate<br />
To inarticulate murmurs dies away,<br />
Whilst the eternal ages watch and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who have given this little chapel to St. Peter&rsquo;s
cherish the hope that perhaps to many of those who may hereafter
pray therein may come that spirit of peace and rest so
beautifully suggested by the New England poet.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
